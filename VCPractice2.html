<p>Makeup application is the process of enhancing or altering oneâ€™s appearance using cosmetic products. It typically begins with a clean and moisturized face, followed by the application of primer to create a smooth base. Foundation is then used to even out the skin tone, and concealer is applied to cover any blemishes or dark circles. Next, powders help set the makeup and reduce shine. Eye makeup, including eyeshadow, eyeliner, and mascara, is used to define the eyes, while eyebrow products shape and fill in the brows. Blush and bronzer add warmth and dimension to the face, and highlighter gives a glowing finish. Lastly, lip products like lipstick or gloss complete the look. Makeup can be subtle or bold depending on the desired effect and the occasion.
